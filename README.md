# BoxOfDevs Team: new-site
Welcome to the repository for the new BoxOfDevs team website! <br>

## Why redesign?
Our existing website (boxofdevs.com) is a mess, and is due for a remake.<br>

## Plans
This newly improved site will have many notable features. Some are addressed in issues, others are not. Wait and see! <br>
A page that needs the most improvement: The projects page! <br>
It will have iFrames to github releases (For stable releases), poggit (for bleeding-edge), and to the commit list (for changelog). 

# HYPE!
